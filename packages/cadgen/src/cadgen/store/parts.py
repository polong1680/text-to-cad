"""A part's display data: ONE index record per part, naming its two objects -- the display
mesh (a GLB body, ``cadgen.store.meshes``) and the selector table
(``cadgen._internal.selector_table``) -- derived from captured immutable geometry inputs,
and read back.

A part is a component under one producer, the kernel that derives it. Its key,
``index/part/<digest>-v<PART_VERSION>``, carries no tolerance: the digest hashes the
component's geometry input (its ``contentHash``: kind, codec, BREP bytes, face colours and
an eager-only component's pinned topology facts) and the producer, and the version is
bumped by any change to the extractor, the selector table, the mesher or the GLB payload,
or in how the digest is hashed.
The record is ``{"glb": {...}, "selectors": {...}}``: each object's address and byte
length and what a reader sizes it by without opening it -- the mesh's decoded-bytes
estimate and counts (and ``unmeshedFaceCount`` when a face could not be meshed), the
table's counts. One probe answers whether a part's display data is stored.

Derivation extracts the component's topology facts in memory (an eager-only component's
are the object its tree pins), builds the selector table from them, meshes the component
from the table and its face colours, writes the two objects and then the record, so a
record always names complete objects. Nothing stores the facts. A mesh export at another
tolerance meshes from the stored table the same way and stores nothing (``mesh_at``).
