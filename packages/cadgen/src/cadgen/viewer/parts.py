"""A runtime view's display data, read from the store: each component's part record
(``cadgen.store.parts``: its display mesh and selector table), which the build that
made the tree derived. A part the store lacks is derived by ONE build-pool job for the
request (``kind: display``); this server never derives.

Tokens are disposable subscribers to that job, never persistent store
entries or editing sessions. Every poll repeats and validates its immutable
inputs. Disconnect/cancellation detaches that subscriber, not another reader,
and never kills a derivation: the daemon finishes the one in hand into the store
and starts no other for a job nobody is subscribed to.

# A tree hash names its bytes, and those bytes name every component the tree pins
# with its entry, so a tree's component map cannot change. The viewer verifies it
# once per process (capture_tree, the complete closure) and keeps it, rather than
# checking the whole closure again on every request: the browser asks about each
# component separately, so that made a model's first open quadratic in its size.
# What can change is whether the objects are still there, since eviction and GC
# delete files. So every request stats the tree's object and the objects of each
# component it names, and a missing one sends the tree back through the complete
# verification, which fails as it always did. A component a request does not name
# is not looked at: a derivation verifies its whole closure before it writes.
