# Migrations

Read this file when source, command syntax or sidecars target a different
cadgen version. `cadgen doctor <skill-dir>` compares the installed version with
the skill's pin. cadgen cuts interfaces over with no compatibility layer: a
retired command, flag, argument, key or import is gone, and fails the way an
unknown one does (an unknown command, an unrecognized argument, an unknown key,
an `ImportError`) without naming what replaced it. The sections below map old
forms to current ones.

## Migration messages

A build, snapshot or check names one migration itself: a sidecar refused for
its schema version. Source or commands written for an older cadgen fail with the
current contract's ordinary errors instead; compare them with the sections
below. The CAD Viewer does not flag a model whose sidecar is refused: until it is
migrated it shows as a plain part, without its kinematics, materials or
animation.

- A refused sidecar (`unsupported sidecar schema N (expected M)`) is replaced by
  rerunning the model's script (`python <model>.py`). An imported STEP with no
  script is re-annotated with `cadgen step build`; clips need a model script.
  Editing `schemaVersion` by hand does not migrate the content.
- A migrated sidecar declares the current schema and the document's hash, the
  build prints no migration warning, a `cadgen step snapshot --kinematics …`
  pose differs from rest, and the Viewer shows the Position tool (and, for a
  model with clips, the Animation tool).
- Rebuilding or re-annotating a document replaces outputs an older cadgen wrote.

## Sidecar schema 10: animation is Python clips

A schema-10 sidecar carries animation as keyframes the build samples from
Python clips. A schema-9 sidecar is refused, and `@step(animation=...)` refuses
a JavaScript module string (`@step animation= must be a dict of clip id ->
cadgen.clip(update, duration=...), got str`). Port each clip in the module's
`export const clips` to a Python function:

```python
# Before: a JavaScript module in a string
ANIMATION = r"""
export const clips = {
  demo: {
    label: "Demo",
    duration: 8,
    loop: false,
    update(t, m) {
      const angle = 60 * (1 - Math.cos(2 * Math.PI * t / 8));
      m.get("forearm").rotate([0, 0, 1], angle, [0, 0, 0]);
      m.get("#o1.3,#o1.4").opacity(0.5);
    },
  },
};
"""
```

```python
# After: Python clips
import math

import cadgen


def demo(t, m):
    angle = 60 * (1 - math.cos(2 * math.pi * t / 8))
    m.get("#forearm").rotate((0, 0, 1), angle, (0, 0, 0))
    m.get("#o1.3", "#o1.4").opacity(0.5)


ANIMATION = {"demo": cadgen.clip(demo, duration=8, loop=False, label="Demo")}
```

- `rotate`, `translate`, `opacity` and `visible` keep their names and
  arguments. `deformTube({rest, path, twistDeg, maxSegmentLength, braid})`
  becomes `deform_tube(rest=..., path=..., twist_deg=...,
  max_segment_length=..., braid=...)`; the paths keep their shape.
- Every target starts with `#`: a bare label becomes `"#label"`, an occurrence
  id is `"#o1.3"`, and a comma list becomes one argument per target. A label
  several parts share moved them all; now it fails, listing numbered aliases
  (`#wheel_1`, `#wheel_2`) to pass instead.
- A group's name moves every part beneath it, and the module's helpers and
  constants become ordinary Python.
- A document annotated with `cadgen step build --animation` has no script to
  rebuild: wrap it in a model script that reads it with `read_step`, and
  declare the clips there.

Rebuilding the model (`python <model>.py`) writes a schema-10 sidecar; a target
no part carries fails the build, naming the clip and the time.

## Meshes come from cadgen in 0.8

cadgen 0.8 meshes every component itself, with OCCT, at one display tolerance,
and every client draws those meshes: the CAD Viewer, snapshots and the CAD app no
longer tessellate, and nothing cadgen runs needs Node.

- `@step` takes no mesh tolerance: delete `mesh_tolerance=` and
  `mesh_angular_tolerance=` from it (`@step got an unexpected keyword argument`).
  A model run (`python <model>.py`) takes no `--mesh-tolerance` or
  `--mesh-angular-tolerance`, and a snapshot job no `quality` key: every view
  and snapshot draws the display tolerance.
- `@stl`/`@glb`/`@threemf` and the export commands keep both tolerances, in the
  same units. An export that names none is written at the display tolerance
  (chord `5e-4` of the bounding diagonal, angle `0.35`), from the meshes the
  viewer draws; a declared export no longer inherits anything from `@step`.

- The first build or export after upgrading rewrites every STL, 3MF and GLB
  once, with OCCT's triangles: the same surfaces within the same tolerances, in
  different bytes. Compare meshes by geometry, not hash.
- A tolerance outside what cadgen meshes is refused before anything builds:
  `mesh_tolerance` below `5e-5` of the bounding diagonal, or
  `mesh_angular_tolerance` below `0.05` or above `1.5708` radians.
- `CADGEN_MESH_CACHE` is gone: a mesh is an ordinary store entry.
- A build now meshes its parts before it reports done, so a view only reads. Each
  model's first `python <model>.py` after upgrading, current or not, meshes its
  parts again, once (`Meshing parts n/total`); a STEP no build has touched since
  is meshed on its first view or snapshot. `cadgen store gc` reclaims what the
  older cadgen stored.

## Snapshot and GLB requests in 0.8

- Section mode is gone: `--mode section` is refused (`Unsupported render mode:
  section. Modes: list, view`), and so are `--section` and a job's `section`
  key. Clip a view and look straight at the cut
  ([cross-sections](snapshot-review.md#cross-sections)): the section plane's
  normal is the clip's `axis` (`XY` is `z`, `XZ` is `y`, `YZ` is `x`), its
  offset is the clip's `at`, and the camera faces the cut (`top`, `back`,
  `right`). A view writes `.png`; nothing writes an SVG outline. So
  `--mode section --section XZ:12.5` becomes:

  ```bash
  cadgen step snapshot STEP/housing.step tmp/cut.png --camera back --display '{"clip": {"axis": "y", "at": 12.5}}'
  ```

- `display.clip` places its plane with `at`, the plane's coordinate on its axis
  in millimetres, in the model's own frame. `offset` and `offsets`, fractions of
  the model's extent along the axis, are refused (`display.clip has unknown
  key(s): offset`). `{"axis": "y", "offset": 0.25}` becomes `{"axis": "y", "at":
  Y}` with `Y = min + 0.25 × (max − min)` over the model's Y extent, which the
  `bounds` that `--mode list` prints give. With no `at` the plane goes through
  the middle. `offsets` kept a fraction for each axis; a clip cuts across its
  one `axis`, so name that axis and its `at`.
- `cadgen glb build --animation` takes no `fps`, `deform` or `deformTolerance`
  (`--animation has unknown key(s): fps; supported keys: clip, drop, seconds,
  start`). The file carries the clip's own keys, not samples at a rate, and
  every bending tube as a glTF skin, so there is no rate or mode to choose:
  delete the keys. `clip`, `seconds`, `start` and `drop` keep their meaning.
